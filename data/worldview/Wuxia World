In the land of Fengyun, martial arts reign supreme, and the mastery of inner energy, or "qi," can elevate a skilled fighter to near-mythical status. Secret sects and schools hidden within mountain temples train warriors in legendary techniques that allow them to leap across rivers, move as swiftly as the wind, or shatter boulders with a single punch. Honor, revenge, and loyalty drive the rivalries between clans, while imperial politics lurk in the shadows, seeking to exploit these powerful martial artists. In this world, a lone swordsman can change the course of history with the swing of a blade.
